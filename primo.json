This is something I've struggled with for a long time, considering that I usually overthink things. For a long time I thought that the best way to do things was to read books about it, figure it out from every angle, then do it, but always with an eye on the reference manuals. Writing melodies reminds me that creating, and doing, are processes we most often can't control. Most of the things we do are much more like rolling a ball down a hill than flying a plane. Planes have lots of controls and require constant monitoring and correcting (as far as I know, I'm not a pilot), but rolling a ball down a hill and trying to hit a target is something you have a very limited amount of control over. You start at the top, you roll it, you see what went wrong and adjust, and then you roll it again.</p><p>There's a famous book on this subject called \"Thinking, Fast and Slow.\" I wasn't able to get more than a few chapters through it because it's too long, and I think the gist of it doesn't really need 32 chapters to explain anyway, but the basic idea is that you have two brains: one thinks fast, the other thinks slow. Most of our decisions are done with the fast brain, but it's the responsibility of the slow brain to train the fast brain.</p><p>When you write a melody, you're entirely using your fast brain. Songwriters often say that they feel like they're getting the melody from somewhere else, because that's what it feels like to write a melody. It's creation that happens naturally, and like so many things is almost more experienced than practiced. </p>","markdown":"# Writing melodies\n\nI've been obsessed with writing melodies for a long time.

They're catchy, I think, but they won't win any awards or be turned into hit songs, although I guess if you were writing music for children you could use some of them.\n\nBut what I really love about it is that it's an exercise in listening to the part of my brain that acts on instinct. This is something I've struggled with for a long time, considering that I usually overthink things. For a long time I thought that the best way to do things was to read books about it, figure it out from every angle, then do it, but always with an eye on the reference manuals. Writing melodies reminds me that creating, and doing, are processes we most often can't control. Most of the things we do are much more like rolling a ball down a hill than flying a plane. Planes have lots of controls and require constant monitoring and correcting (as far as I know, I'm not a pilot), but rolling a ball down a hill and trying to hit a target is something you have a very limited amount of control over. You start at the top, you roll it, you see what went wrong and adjust, and then you roll it again.\n\nThere's a famous book on this subject called \"Thinking, Fast and Slow.\" I wasn't able to get more than a few chapters through it because it's too long, and I think the gist of it doesn't really need 32 chapters to explain anyway, but the basic idea is that you have two brains: one thinks fast, the other thinks slow. Most of our decisions are done with the fast brain, but it's the responsibility of the slow brain to train the fast brain.\n\nWhen you write a melody, you're entirely using your fast brain. Songwriters often say that they feel like they're getting the melody from somewhere else, because that's what it feels like to write a melody. It's creation that happens naturally, and like so many things is almost more experienced than practiced.\n\n"}}},"page":"e4a45b1d-e11e-454e-ad02-a59b56e67b94","symbol":"82fca3a2-fbac-47d1-9f97-97bfcbafe7a8","index":0},{"id":"f5621485-27db-44ed-ba3d-e03a8a7966aa","content":{"en":{"logo":{"image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400?blur=10","size":null},"title":"Ea reprehenderit ipsum"},"site_nav":[{"link":{"url":"/","label":"Home"}},{"link":{"url":"/","label":"Resume"}},{"link":{"url":"https://primosites.vercel.app/resume","label":"Talks"}}]}},"page":"ba64a6dc-7e19-40c0-b148-c0f7cacd3c62","symbol":"0487a421-b44f-4e97-850f-55b5592a1def","index":0},{"id":"e5cd4d2a-c0aa-41fb-8bd7-a566f0a8169d","content":{"en":{"name":"Mateo Morris","image":{"alt":"","src":"https://picsum.photos/600/400","url":"https://picsum.photos/600/400","size":null},"title":"Frontend Developer","skills":[{"item":"Semantic HTML"},{"item":"CSS (PostCSS, SCSS)"},{"item":"JavaScript (ES6)"},{"item":"Svelte, React, React Native"}],"contact":{"email":"mateo@primo.so","phone":"+1 703-789-3433","address":"3344 Confederate Point Rd.
